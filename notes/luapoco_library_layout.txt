* Threading issues
----------------------------------------
threading / thread pools / notifications / events / etc.
need to do some serialization mechanism.
perhaps creating threads based on lua_load() (file/string) or string.dump(),
	and a table that represents the runnable/task interface.
		class LuaThreadTask to run inside of a TaskManager (no way to intra-thread-com?)
		via Pipes like stdin/stdout on a process
		via SharedMemory and some abstraction on top of it (rwlocks and a notification/event or something?)
